                <h2>ALBERT EINSTEIN</h2>
                <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist,
                     widely <em> acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most
                      influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best 
                      known for developing the theory of relativity </em>, but he
                       also made important contributions to the development
                        of the theory of quantum mechanics. Wikipedia

              <p>Quantum mechanics is the study of matter and its 
                interactions with energy on the scale of atomic and
                subatomic particles. By contrast, classical physics
                explains matter and energy only on a scale familiar
                to human experience, including the behavior of
                astronomical bodies such as the Moon. Classical
                physics is still used in much of modern science
                 and technology. However, towards the end of the
                 19th century, scientists discovered phenomena in both
                the large (macro) and the small (micro) worlds that 
                classical physics could not explain.[1] The desire to
                resolve inconsistencies between observed phenomena and 
                classical theory led to two major revolutions in physics 
                that created a shift in the original scientific paradigm: 
                the theory of relativity and the development of quantum 
                mechanics.[2] This article describes how physicists 
                discovered the limitations of classical physics and 
                developed the main concepts of the quantum theory that 
                replaced it in the early decades of the 20th century. 
                It describes these concepts in roughly the order in which 
                they were first discovered. For a more complete history
